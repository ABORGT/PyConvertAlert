    Library to easily convert alerts into Alert Manager compatible alerts.

    Alert Manager comes packaged with Prometheus and is a very useful system
    for tracking alerts. Alert rules are typically defined and when that
    criteria is met, Alert Manager receives an alert from Prometheus. What if
    your system utilizes multiple alerting systems, like Rackspace Intelligence
    or Uptime Robot? These too can be pushed to Alert Manager. This lib aims to
    make that conversion as simple as possible.

            resultant Alert Manager Alert object. The mapper should be a dict

        In order to handle situations where a key might exist twice in the
        alert on which we run our lookup, we can specify a list of keys to
        iterate over. Essentially, if a list is provided as the value to one of
        our corresponding alert manager alert keys, we will search for the
        first key in the list, return it's value, then search for the next key
        etc. Finally when we reach the end of our list, the value returned
        should be the result of all searches. This is a protected method and
        should only be used in the public convert_it method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        keys_list : list of str
            This is the list of keys to drill down on. It will be iterated over
            until we reach the end of the list, providing the more specific key
            lookup to prevent multiple values for a single lookup.

        lookup_dict : dict
